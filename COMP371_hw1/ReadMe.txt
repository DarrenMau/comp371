Programming Assignment 1

I used visual studio 2015 virtual C++ using the skeleton code provided.
The program will read input_a1.txt.If the first character read is 0, the program will create a field using translation.
If the first character read is 1, it will create circles from z-axis and connect the circles together using triangles.
The program features:
mouse press and hold left button and draw will move the camera forward or backward.
When the camera get close to the object, some pixel will start to turn black.
arrow keys: rotate the mesh.
W key: change the rendering to lines
P key: change the rendering to points
T key: change the rendering to triangles
